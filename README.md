# HomePowerBank

This project is a combined hardware-software effort around designing a control / management system for a home power bank. Unlike commercial USB power banks, this one is intended to serve as a sort of "generator substitute," having a stack of batteries large enough to supply an inverter during situations that otherwise lack power (general outage, off-grid living, etc).
